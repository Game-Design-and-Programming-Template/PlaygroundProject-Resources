## Unity Playground Videos

This set of videos, from the 2017 Global Game Jam provides a great introduction to what you can do with the Playground Project toolkit. The presenter is the developer of the Playground project. Watch _at least_ two of the videos **and take notes.** Look for ideas that you can use in your games and to see how a developer works.
