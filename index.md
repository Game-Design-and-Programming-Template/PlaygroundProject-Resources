## Unity Playground Videos

This set of videos, from the [2017 Global Game Jam][ggj-2017], provides a great introduction to what you can do with the Playground Project toolkit. The presenter is the developer of the Playground project. Watch _at least_ two of the videos **and take notes.** Look for ideas to use in your game and also to see how a developer works.

If you are doing a project "from scratch" you may select _any_ videos, articles, or tutorials that are relevant to your project. Please be sure to cite them in your notes – or better yet practice your Markdown skills and include your citations in your online documentation.

If you need to refer to the daily reflection questions, you can find them [here](https://gitpitch.com/CS-Templates/Notebook-Reflection).
